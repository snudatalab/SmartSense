# Samsung SmartThings Internet of Things (IoT) datasets
The datasets are used for SmartSense, which is a paper submitted to CIKM 2022.

We provide datasets collected from SmartThings which is a worldwide Internet of Things (IoT) platform with 62 million users. 
Our datasets consist of log datasets, routine datasets, and dictionaries.
The log datasets are collected for a month from 4 different countries: Korea, USA, Spain, and France, respectively.
The routine datasets are collected from 3 different regions: Asia-Pacific, North America, and Europe, respectively.
The dictionaries provide mappings between names and ids, for day of weeks, hours, devices, and device controls.
We provide data separately by countries in repositories `kr`, `us`, `sp`, and `fr`, each of which corresponds to Korea, USA, Spain, and France, respectively.
### Log dataset
Each log dataset is a tensor of size [N x 10 x 4], where N is the number of instances.
Each instance of the log dataset contains ten consecutive actions performed by a user of Bixby service.
Each action of the instance is represented as a vector of length 4.
Elements of the vector represent day of week, hour, device, and device control in order.
We randomly split instances in 7:1:2 ratio, and provide them as: `trn_instance_10.pkl`, `vld_instance_10.pkl`, and `test_instance_10.pkl`.
### Routine dataset
A routine is a sequence of devices triggered by a pre-defined condition or a request from a user.
Each line of the routine dataset denotes a sequence of devices in a routine.
We provide the routine datasets as: `routine_device_corpus.txt`.
We have two versions of Europe routine datasets for Spain and France since the device ids for Spain and those for France are different.
### Dictionary
A Dictionary define name-to-id mappings of day of weeks, hours, devices, and device controls.
We provide the dictionaries as: `dictionary.py`.
